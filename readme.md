<h1>React Rainbow Redux!</h1>

<p>
Version 2 of the React Rainbow Challenge. This version consists of 2 components. Rainbow, and RainbowRow. Rainbow will draw RainbowRow's from data passed into the Rainbow as a 'data' property. Eventually this should be probably fed from a source, and acquired via a GET.
</p>

<p>
2 'states' can be manipulated here. Each row has a state for whether it's clicked(highlighted) or not, and the options box will call a re-render of Rainbow using the boolean value from itself to set the state on Rainbow triggering a re-render with double rows (doubles the data source to draw from).
